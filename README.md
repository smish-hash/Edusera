<b> Concepts & Functionality used : </b>

The application uses Modern Android Development at its core and uses architecture patterns to work efficiently. 
- MVVM : Handles all the background tasks, navigation, and lifecycle management.
- Room : Data from the internet is stored in a room database making data persistent.
- Retrofit : Retrofit handles all the api calls and is responsible for getting data from the internet.
- Glide : The image loading and caching library to enable smooth conversion of image from its URL.  
- Navigation Architecture : The component that allows user to navigate from one page to another is handled by the navigation architecture components.
- RecyclerView : To present the lists of different types of courses and its data.
- LiveData : LiveData is the observable data which is reflected in the view.
- YouTube API : To enable youtube videos to be able to play in the application itself.
